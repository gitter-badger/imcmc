[1] found a bug in parser++.cpp, in 
	bool Is_Commented(...),
which might cause memory leak.

[2] also added a new function, Remove_TabSpace(), which can handle the unwanted 'tabs' when reading
bool values, since bools values are actually readed in as strings...


[3] and optimized Num_of_Value(), with the following

    for( std::string::size_type i=0; i!=subline.size(); ++i ){
        if( subline[i] == ',' )
            subline[i] = ' ';
    }

updated to 

    for( std::string::size_type i=0; i!=subline.size(); ++i ){
        if( subline[i] == ',' || subline[i] == '\t')	//	@2015-4-30
            subline[i] = ' ';
    }

so that all 'tabs' will also replaced by space

Solved the problem of undefined refernece to cblas_**** when using mpic++ compiled with gcc version
greater than 4.4 (gcc-4.6, gcc-4.7, gcc-4.8 and gcc-4.9), added a LDFLAGS into Makefile.am in the 
tests folder, see the changes there:

SOMEPROG_test_LDFLAGS = -Wl,--no-as-needed

BUT please remember that this is tested only with gcc-compiled mpic++.  When using intel-compiled
mpic++, no such problems and there is no needed to use the flag "-Wl, --no-as-needed"

added a new flag: 
	use_cosmomc_std_format
this can be used to control the first column of the outputed chains.

if use_cosmomc_std_format = true, then the first column elements are just 1, (remember that in CosmoMC
this number might not be 1, which are the iterations of staying at that parameter point)

if use_cosmomc_std_format = false, then the first column elements are truly the probability of that
sample, and this is exactly the same with MultiNest.

1) optimized void emcee::init_walkers() to support parallel initialization
2) void emcee::reset_walkers() no longer called inside void emcee_workspace::do_sampling()
